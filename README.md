# CustomPresentation

This application demonstrates custom transitions that combine and coordinate between multiple animations using [UIViewPropertyAnimator](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiviewpropertyanimator) and [view controller transition APIs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/animation_and_haptics/view_controller_transitions). 

The idea of coordinating multiple animations was explained in the [_Advance Animation with UIKit_ WWDC 2017 session 230](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017/230/). This application is implemented by referring to that method.
